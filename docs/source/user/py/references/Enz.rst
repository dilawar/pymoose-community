.. py:class:: Enz


   .. py:method:: setKmK1

      (*destination message field*)      Low-level function used when you wish to explicitly set Km and k1, without doing any of the volume calculations.Needed by ReadKkit and other situations where the numbers must be set before all the messaging is in place.Not relevant for zombie enzymes.
