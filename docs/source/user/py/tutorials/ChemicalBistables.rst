Chemical Bistables
******************

A `bistable system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistability>`_ is a dynamic system that has two stable equilibrium states. The following examples can be used to teach and demonstrate different aspects of bistable systems or to learn how to model them using moose. Each example contains a short description, the model's code, and the output with default settings. 

Each example can be found as a python file within the main moose folder under 
::

    (...)/moose/moose-examples/tutorials/ChemicalBistables

In order to run the example, run the script
::

    python filename.py

in command line, where ``filename.py`` is the name of the python file you would like to run. The filenames of each example are written in **bold** at the beginning of their respective sections, and the files themselves can be found in the aformentioned directory.

In chemical bistable models that use solvers, there are optional arguments that allow you to specify which solver you would like to use.
:: 

    python filename.py [gsl | gssa | ee]

Where:

 - gsl: This is the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg implementation from the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). It is a fifth order variable timestep explicit method. Works well for most reaction systems except if they have very stiff reactions.
 - gssl: Optimized Gillespie stochastic systems algorithm, custom implementation. This uses variable timesteps internally. Note that it slows down with increasing numbers of molecules in each pool. It also slows down, but not so badly, if the number of reactions goes up.
 - Exponential Euler:This methods computes the solution of partial and ordinary differential equations.

All the following examples can be run with either of the three solvers, each of which has different advantages and disadvantages and each of which might produce a slightly different outcome. 

Simply running the file without the optional argument will by default use the ``gsl`` solver. These ``gsl`` outputs are the ones shown below.

Simple Bistables
================

Filename: **simpleBis.py**


This example shows the key property of a chemical bistable system: it
has two stable states. Here we start out with the system settling rather
quickly to the first stable state, where molecule A is high (blue) and
the complementary molecule B (green) is low. At t = 100s, we deliver a
perturbation, which is to move 90% of the A molecules into B. This
triggers a state flip, which settles into a distinct stable state where
there is more of B than of A. At t = 200s we reverse the flip by moving
99% of B molecules back to A.

If we run the simulation with the gssa option python simpleBis.py gssa

we see exactly the same sequence of events, except now the switch is
noisy. The calculations are now run with the Gillespie Stochastic
Systems Algorithm (gssa) which incorporates probabilistic reaction
events. The switch still switches but one can see that it might flip
spontaneously once in a while.

Things to do: 

1. Open a copy of the script file in an editor, and around
line 124 and 129 you will see how the state flip is implemented while
maintaining mass conservation. What happens if you flip over fewer
molecules? What is the threshold for a successful flip? Why are these
thresholds different for the different states?

2. Try different volumes in line 31, and rerun using the gssa. Will you
   see more or less noise if you increase the volume to 1e-20 m^3?

Scale Volumes
=============

File name: **scaleVolumes.py**

This script runs exactly the same model as in simpleBis.py, but it
automatically scales the volumes from 1e-19 down to smaller values.

Note how the simulation successively becomes noisier, until at very
small volumes there are spontaneous state transitions.

Strong Bistable System
======================

File name: **strongBis.py**

This example illustrates a particularly strong, that is, parametrically
robust bistable system. The model topology is symmetric between
molecules **b** and **c**. We have both positive feedback of molecules
**b** and **c** onto themselves, and also inhibition of **b** by **c**
and vice versa.

.. image:: ../../../images/strongBis.png

Open the python file to see what is happening. The simulation starts at
a symmetric point and the model settles at precisely the balance point
where **a**, **b**, and **c** are at the same concentration. At t= 100
we apply a small molecular 'tap' to push it over to a state where **c**
is larger. This is stable. At t = 210 we apply a moderate push to show
that it is now very stably in this state, and the system rebounds to its

MAPK Feedback Model
===================

File name: **mapkFB.py**

This example illustrates loading, and running a kinetic model for a much
more complex bistable positive feedback system, defined in kkit format.
This is based on Bhalla, Ram and Iyengar, Science 2002.

The core of this model is a positive feedback loop comprising of the
MAPK cascade, PLA2, and PKC. It receives PDGF and Ca2+ as inputs.

.. image:: ../../../images/mapkFB.png

This model is quite a large one and due to some stiffness in its
equations, it takes about 30 seconds to execute. Note that this is still
200 times faster than the events it models.

The simulation illustrated here shows how the model starts out in a
state of low activity. It is induced to 'turn on' when a a PDGF stimulus
is given for 400 seconds, starting at t = 500s. After it has settled to
the new 'on' state, the model is made to 'turn off' by setting the
system calcium levels to zero. This inhibition starts at t = 2900 and
goes on for 500 s.

Note that this is a somewhat unphysiological manipulation! Following
this the model settles back to the same 'off' state it was in
originally.

Propogation of a Bistable System
================================

File name: **propagationBis.py**

All the above models have been well-mixed, that is point or non-spatial
models. Bistables do interesting things when they are dispersed in
space. This is illustrated in this example. Here we have a tapering
cylinder, that is a pseudo 1-dimensional reaction-diffusion system.
Every point in this cylinder has the bistable system from the strongBis
example.

.. image:: ../../../images/propBis.png

The example has two stages. First it starts out with the model in the
unstable transition point, and introduces a small symmetry-breaking
perturbation at one end. This rapidly propagates through the entire
length model, leaving molecule **b** at a higher value than **c**.

At t = 100 we carry out a different manipulation. We flip the
concentrations of molecules b and c for the left half of the model, and
then just let it run. Now we have opposing bistable states on either
half. In the middle, the two systems battle it out. Molecule **c** from
the left side diffuses over to the right, and tries to inhibit **b**,
and vice versa. However we have a small asymmetry due to the tapering of
the cylinder. As there is a slightly larger volume on the left, the
transition point gradually advances to the right, as molecule **b**
yields to the slightly larger amounts of molecule **c**.

    This example illustrates propagation of state flips in a 
    linear 1-dimensional reaction-diffusion system. It uses a 
    bistable system loaded in from a kkit definition file, and
    places this in a tapering cylinder for pseudo 1-dimentionsional 
    diffusion.
    
    This example illustrates a number of features of reaction-diffusion
    calculations. 
    
    First, it shows how to set up such systems. Key steps are to create
    the compartment and define its voxelization, then create the Ksolve, 
    Dsolve, and Stoich. Then we assign stoich.compartment, ksolve and
    dsolve in that order. Finally we assign the path of the Stoich.
    
    For running the model, we start by introducing
    a small symmetry-breaking increment of concInit
    of the molecule **b** in the last compartment on the cylinder. The model
    starts out with molecules at equal concentrations, so that the system would
    settle to the unstable fixed point. This symmetry breaking leads
    to the last compartment moving towards the state with an 
    increased concentration of **b**,
    and this effect propagates to all other compartments.
    
    Once the model has settled to the state where **b** is high throughout, 
    we simply exchange the concentrations of **b** with **c** in the left
    half of the cylinder. This introduces a brief transient at the junction,
    which soon settles to a smooth crossover.
    
    Finally, as we run the simulation, the tapering geometry comes into play.
    Since the left hand side has a larger diameter than the right, the
    state on the left gradually wins over and the transition point slowly
    moves to the right.

Steady-state Finder
===================

File name: **findSteadyState**

This is an example of how to use an internal MOOSE solver to find steady
states of a system very rapidly. The method starts from a random
position in state space that obeys mass conservation. It then finds the
nearest steady state and reports it. If it does this enough times it
should find all the steady states.

We illustrate this process for 50 attempts to find the steady states. It
does find all of them. Each time it plots and prints the values, though
the plotting is not necessary.

The printout shows the concentrations of all molecules in the first 5
columns. Then it prints the type of solution, and the numbers of
negative and positive eigenvalues. In all cases the calculations are
successful, though it takes different numbers of iterations to arrive at
the steady state. In some models it would be necessary to put a cap on
the number of iterations, if the system is not able to find a steady
state.

In this example we run the bistable model using the ODE solver right at
the end, and manually enforce transitions to show where the target
steady states are.

For more information on the algorithm used, look in the comments within
the main method of the code below.

        This example sets up the kinetic solver and steady-state finder, on
        a bistable model of a chemical system. The model is set up within the
        script.
        The algorithm calls the steady-state finder 50 times with different
        (randomized) initial conditions, as follows:
    
        * Set up the random initial condition that fits the conservation laws
        * Run for 2 seconds. This should not be mathematically necessary, but
          for obscure numerical reasons it makes it much more likely that the
          steady state solver will succeed in finding a state.
        * Find the fixed point
        * Print out the fixed point vector and various diagnostics.
        * Run for 10 seconds. This is completely unnecessary, and is done here
          just so that the resultant graph will show what kind of state has
          been  found.
    
        After it does all this, the program runs for 100 more seconds on the
        last found fixed point (which turns out to be a saddle node), then
        is hard-switched in the script to the first attractor basin from which
        it runs for another 100 seconds till it settles there, and then
        is hard-switched yet again to the second attractor and runs for 400
        seconds.
    
        Looking at the output you will see many features of note:
    
        * the first attractor (stable point) and the saddle point (unstable
          fixed point) are both found quite often. But the second
          attractor is found just once.
          It has a very small basin of attraction.
        * The values found for each of the fixed points match well with the
          values found by running the system to steady-state at the end.
        * There are a large number of failures to find a fixed point. These are
          found and reported in the diagnostics. They show up on the plot
          as cases where the 10-second runs are not flat.
    
        If you wanted to find fixed points in a production model, you would
        not need to do the 10-second runs, and you would need to eliminate the
        cases where the state-finder failed. Then you could identify the good
        points and keep track of how many of each were found.
    
        There is no way to guarantee that all fixed points have been found
        using this algorithm! If there are points in an obscure corner of state
        space (as for the singleton second attractor convergence in this
        example) you may have to iterate very many times to find them.
    
        You may wish to sample concentration space logarithmically rather than
        linearly.

Dose Response (Under construction)
==================================

File name: **doseResponse.py**

This example generates a doseResponse plot for a bistable system,
against a control parameter (dose) that takes the system in and out
again from the bistable regime. Like the previous example, it uses the
steady-state solver to find the stable points for each value of the
control parameter. Unfortunately it doesn't work right now. Seems like
the kcat scaling isn't being registered.
